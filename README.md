# interior Even the most well-intended designs can go wrong if you overlook key principles. Here are common interior design mistakes and how to fix them.

1. Choosing the Wrong Paint Color First
Paint should be the last step after selecting furniture and decor.
Test different shades on the wall before finalizing a color.
2. Overcrowding the Space
Avoid too much furniture—leave enough open space for movement.
Stick to essential pieces and opt for smart storage solutions.
3. Poor Lighting Choices
A single ceiling light is not enough; layer your lighting.
Use a combination of overhead, task, and accent lighting.
4. Ignoring Scale & Proportion
Large furniture in a small room can make it feel cramped.
Keep a balance by mixing different sizes and heights.
5. Neglecting Functionality
Aesthetic appeal is important, but comfort and practicality should not be compromised.
Choose furniture that is stylish yet comfortable and suitable for daily use.
By avoiding these mistakes, you can create a well-balanced and elegant home.
